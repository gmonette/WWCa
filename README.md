# WWCa
Stratification functions for datassist

This package produces weighted sample survey estimates using population frequencies. It was inspired by the
[WWC package](https://github.com/heathermkrause/WWC) and explores some alternate approaches.

To do:
1. Consider incorporating stepwise weighting schemes from [Jeremy Strief and Glen Meeden (2013) "Objective stepwise Bayes weights in survey sampling," _Survey Methodology_,  __39__, 1, pp. 1-27](http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/12-001-x/12-001-x2013001-eng.pdf)
